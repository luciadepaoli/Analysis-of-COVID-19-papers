# Analysis of COVID-19 papers on distributed machine using DASK
## Project for Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets course at University of Padua.

**Authors**: Lucia Depaoli, Alessandro Fella, Simone Mistrali

**Project Summary**: This distributed computing project will focus on the analysis of $1000$ papers about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and related corona viruses. The dataset is a sub-sample of $1000$ items taken from the original dataset that is composed of more than $75000$ papers. This dataset is a part of real-world research on COVID-19 named COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). The research and related challenges are available on the dedicated [page](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) on Kaggle.
